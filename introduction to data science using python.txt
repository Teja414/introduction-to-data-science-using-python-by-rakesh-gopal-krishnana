supervised machine learning  : when the data has both input and output and it is given to the model then it is termed as supervised machine learning

unsupervised learning : the data has only input no outputs , the alogorithms will classify them into cluster basing on some factors
1. centriod bases algorithms
2. Density bases algorithms

input data ------>    machine learning algorithms ----------> output/patterns/insights

Scikit Learn : library of python for performing machine learning tasks by building machine learningmodels very easily  yand also input manupulations


categories of machine learning algorithms : 
1. Classification
2. clustering
3. regression
4. dimensionality reduction


inputs are called featues and outputs are called predictions 

key in machine learning : choose accurate data and the model which will provide the closeness in the outputs.

UCI - it is website were we can find huge quantoty of datasets for machine leaning problems.

#bunch is sklearn datatype which stores data, target , feature name , and target names

in classification problems the input may be infinite but the output are finite ex: spam email classification to be either 0 spam or 1 not spam

K-Fold cross validation : it tries different combinations of data to be test data and training data in each iteration adn gives output accuracy in each iteration. here K is the no. of iterations
